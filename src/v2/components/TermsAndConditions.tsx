          fees) (“Losses”) by or with respect to any matters pertaining to your

          are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitration
          panel in a final non-appealable judgment or order to have resulted
          solely from Joystick or its affiliates' gross negligence or willful
          misconduct. In addition, you agree that Joystick and its respective
          partners, managing directors, officers, directors, attorneys,

          services), or (iv) the failure by any person not controlled by the

          clearing organization, or other third party or any of their respective
          agents or affiliates, of its or their obligations relative to any
          Cryptocurrency. I agree that Indemnified Parties will have no
          liability, to you or to third parties, or responsibility whatsoever
          for: (i) any Losses resulting from a cause over which Indemnified
          Parties do not have direct control, including but not limited to the
          failure of mechanical equipment, unauthorized access, theft, operator
          errors, government restrictions, force majeure, exchange rulings or
