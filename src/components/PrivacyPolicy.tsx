        SCOPE
        <br />
        This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by us,
        including on our website located at joystickgames.com (the "Site"). To
        make this Privacy Policy easier to read, our Site and the content and
        functionalities accessible via the Site are collectively referred to as
        the "Site." For the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Policy does not
        apply to the decentralized digital ecosystem developed by the Joystick
        Games (the "Protocol") and the Joystick Games cannot control activity
        and data on the Protocol, the validation of transactions on the
        Protocol, or use of the Protocol. The Protocol is an open-source
        protocol that is maintained and processed by validators across the
        globe.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY

        We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time at our sole
        discretion. If there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we
        will notify you as required by applicable law. You understand and agree
        that you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy if
        you continue to use our Site after the new Privacy Policy takes effect.

      </p>
      <p>
        De-identified and Aggregated Information. We may use personal

      <p>
        HOW WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION
        <br />
        We disclose your information to third parties for a variety of business

        the event of a major business transaction such as a merger, sale, or
        asset transfer, as described below.
      </p>
      <p>
        A. DISCLOSURES TO PROVIDE OUR SITE
        <br />
        The categories of third parties with whom we may share your information
        are described below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice Regarding Use of Blockchain. Transactions involving Joystick
        Tokens will be conducted via the Ethereum blockchain. Information about
        your transfers will be provided to the blockchain and may be accessible
        to third parties due to the public nature of the blockchain. Because
        entries to the blockchain are, by their nature, public, and because it
        may be possible for someone to identify you through your pseudonymous,
        public wallet address using external sources of information, any
        transaction you enter onto the blockchain could possibly be used to
        identify you or information about you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other Users of the Site and Parties You Transact With. Some of your
        personal information may be visible to other users of the Site (e.g.,
        information featured on generally accessible parts of your profile). In
        addition, to complete transfers via the Site, we will need to share some
        of your personal information with the party that you are transacting
        with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third-Party Websites and Applications. You may choose to share personal
        information or interact with third-party websites and/or third-party
        applications, including, but not limited to, third-party electronic
        wallet extensions. Once your personal information has been shared with a
        third-party website or a third-party application, it will also be
        subject to such third-party's privacy policy. We encourage you to
        closely read each third-party website or third-party application privacy
        policy before sharing your personal information or otherwise interacting
        with them. Please note that we do not control, and we are not
        responsible for the third-party website's or the third-party
        application's processing of your personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Service Providers. We may share your personal information with our
        third-party service providers who use that information to help us
        provide our Site. This includes service providers that provide us with
        IT support, hosting, customer service, and related services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Business Partners. We may share your personal information with business
        partners to provide you with a product or service you have requested. We
        may also share your personal information to business partners with whom
        we jointly offer products or services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Affiliates. We may share your personal information with members of our
        corporate family.

        may set Technologies and other tracking tools on our Site to collect
        information regarding your activities and your device (e.g., your IP
        address, cookie identifiers, page(s) visited, location, time of day).
        These advertising partners may use this information (and similar
        information collected from other services) for purposes of delivering
        personalized advertisements to you when you visit digital properties
        within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as
        "interest-based advertising" or "personalized advertising."
      </p>
      <p>
        APIs/SDKs. We may use third-party application program interfaces

        doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement or
        national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or
        subpoena; protect your, our, or others' rights, property, or safety;
        enforce our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist
        with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal
        activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        C. DISCLOSURE IN THE EVENT OF MERGER, SALE, OR OTHER ASSET TRANSFERS
        <br />
        If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence,
        reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or
        transition of service to another provider, your information may be sold
        or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or
        contract.
